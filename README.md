# crazy-crazy-taxi

Team: Layann Wardeh, Margaret Aiyenero, Mary Briamonte


We are building a replica of the Wild Wild Taxi game but on a gameboy-like device. The point of the game is to reach the target distance within the time limit while jumping over hurdles and also moving past other taxis. On the web application, you use the left and right arrow keys to steer, press the up and down keys to control the speed, and the Spacebar to jump (because cars levitate now). We plan to implement these same features, but with the physical buttons on the a gameboy. We will use a Raspberry Pi compute module 4 to do this, as well as, raylib for graphics. All three of us with work on all parts. This game is a game played by Layann during her teenage years, and is a nice throwback and a great learning experience for the whole team. Through implementing this game, we will not only learn about graphics through raylib, but also will learn how to integrate external hardware into the software we built (something Mary and Layann should have done more as CPEGs but didnâ€™t have the opportunity to through the required classes we take).
